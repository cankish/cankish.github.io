                    Did fairly well. But overall unsatisfied with my understanding. <br>
                    Explored a lot of fields, attempted to make a mobile application for the impaired for audio from mixed sources to text<br>

                    I became a sneaker head. I tried my hands out in Robotics.

                    Got interested in Probabilities and Information.<br>
                    rAnd made lots of deep connections independetly, primarily thinking about Machine Learning and Search Algorithms. 
                    But as I suspect has applications to parts of Physics including Quantum Theory, General Relativity and Statistical Mechanics.

                    A truly unusual time, something I couldn't have imagined. A huge Attention Spurr by my institute perhaps due to my deep insights, which were helpful in Mahcine Learning as well as parts of Physics, which I was on the way to make them publishable.<br>
                    Some opportunistic elements exploited me and my time and made buissness out of it, as I suspect by extracting personal information, academic trajectory and intellectual property.<br>
                    I experienced scooping, no privacy, personal comments in online classes. I had to quit attending classes to keep my calm and peace and safegaurd my thoughts.<br>

                    With some exchange of emails and complaints with the concerned authority. I had to start an extension year with a plan to avoid the opportunistic elements.<br>
                    Currently, exploring Quantum Theory and hoping to make more connections.
